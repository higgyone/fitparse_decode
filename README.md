# fitparse_decode
Decode heartrate data from Garmin FIT files using fitparse from https://github.com/dtcooper/python-fitparse.

This is a basic programme to extract heart rate data with timestamp from .fit files.

The code was quick extraction of data and is for refernce only. It is complete as far as it worked for me and I wont be updataing it unless totally necessary.
